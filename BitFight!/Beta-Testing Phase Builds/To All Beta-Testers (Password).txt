Hello,

You have been selected to prototype BitFight!, a game created by Amrit Amar. You job is to find bugs or any minor improvements that can be made in the game. You must play the game this weekend, and on Monday, report it to me.

The Password to the Archive is "bitfight2014" (without the quotes). All and any criticism is accepted, but not nonsense.

Again, thanks a lot for Testing this game for me, and I hope that the Game is fun for you, as well as frustating, as it was for me! Remember to check the Instructions if you want to know how to play!

Notable Bugs:
 - Endless Survival RANDOMLY adds Points (like what?)
 - ZomBits may be a bit glitchy with Walls Power Up!

Good Luck!

SirHack3r, Signing Out.
