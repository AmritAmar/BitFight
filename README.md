BitFight (Final Release)
=============

BitFight (this final version) is a game created by Amrit Amar for the International African Game Programming Championship 2014, and this is the release version of the game, made over the course of the tournament for the final rounds.

It is a 2D retro-style, simplistic game with the main motive of dodging enemies. The primary aim of the game is to dodge Enemy bits in a zero-graviy environment. There are many gamemodes with powerups and special abilities that make this a challenging game.

This game won the competition in 2014 by getting the most votes through a public voting process. This is the final version of the game and is no longer in development (unless, of course, I improve it in the  near future once I gain more knowledge in CS).
